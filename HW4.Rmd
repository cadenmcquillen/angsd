Copy metadata to cluster and get WT2 ENA codes
```{bash, eval = FALSE}

Create and move WT2 fastqs to new directory
```{bash, eval = FALSE}

#Realized this could have been included in the shell script but already had done it separately
mkdir WT2
mv ERR458878.fastq.gz WT2

## Part 1: Question 2
There are seven technical replicates distributed over seven lanes for each sample therefore there are seven fastq files for the WT2 sample. Each file represents a different lane.

scp cnm4001@aphrodite.med.cornell.edu:/home/cnm4001/angsd_hw/hw4/WT1/ERR458493_fastqc.html .

```
I changed stringency from 1 to 3 and added the --fastqc flag so that it runs fastqc automatically after performing trim galore. 

## Part 2: Question 3
The GC% percentage (both 43%) did not change between the trimmed and untrimmed in the QC reports.This is probably because when we the total percentage of sequence we trim is fairly small. Since the QC before trimming was already pretty good, we mainly removed potential adaptors which would we a small proportion of the total amount of sequence. Therefore the global GC% isn't likely to change that much. The sequence length distribution changes from one peak at 51 for untrimmed to a range from 20-51 for the trim. This is because we are trimming sequences that probably contain an adapter sequence when we run trim galore therefore we will have some sequences which we trim that will have a shorter sequence length post trimming. 

## Part 2: Question 4

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd angsd_hw/hw4
mamba activate multiqc
multiqc .

#On local machine, copy html report from cluster to local machine
scp cnm4001@aphrodite.med.cornell.edu:/home/cnm4001/angsd_hw/hw4/multiqc_report.html .
```

red = SNF2 \
blue = WT \
![Per Sequence Quality Scores WT and SNF2.](/Users/Caden/Desktop/angsd/fastqc_per_sequence_quality_scores_plot.png)


## Part 2: Question 5

In the multiQC report, for every sample there is slight variation between all the technical replicates. However, if you examine the QC for all technical replicates within one sample and determine that all replicates QC looks good enough and are all within a close range of each other then you could be justified in combining them into a single fastq file. 

In my opinion I wouldn't and would just keep all technical replicates separate because maybe the QC all looks good but you notice something odd when you are doing downstream analysis and it would be easier to remove and deal with if all the technical replicates are separate. 

## Part 2: Question 6

```{bash, eval = FALSE}

cat > SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458514.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458515.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458516.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458517.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458518.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458519.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq
cat ERR458520.fastq >> SNF2_1_combined.fastq


```


## Part 2: Question 7
I would first grab every fourth line from the fastq file. This would then be a file containing all the phred scores for every read and nothing else. \
First: \
I would check for any characters between "!" through ":", if there was one or more of these charterers then we would know its either Sanger or Illumina 1.8+. If we did find one or more of those previously mentioned characters, I would then check for "J" because if there was one that would mean we were using Illumina 1.8+, otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell between Sanger and Illumina 1.8. \

Second: \
Assuming there wasn't one of the characters "!" through ":", I would then check for "K" through "h". These would only be found in +64 offset phred scores (Illumina 1.3,Illumina 1.5, Solexa). Assuming we did find one of those characters, I would then check for ";" through "?" which would only be found if it was Solexa. If none of those characters were found then I would check for "@" or "A". These are only found in Solexa and Illumina 1.3, if one was present we would know it was NOT Illumina 1.5 but wouldn't be able to distinguished between Illumina 1.3 and Solexa. Lastly, if "@" or "A" was not found then it could be any of Solexa, Illumina 1.3, or illumina 1.5.
